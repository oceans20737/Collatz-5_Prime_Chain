5-adic Collatz Prime Chains
===========================

A research project exploring rare prime number sequences generated by an extended 5-adic Collatz-like map:

f(n) = (6n + c) / 5,  where c ∈ {−3, −1, +1, +3}

The constant c is selected based on n mod 5 to ensure the numerator is divisible by 5 and remains odd.
This parity-preserving method avoids even-number traps and enables the discovery of long prime chains.

Overview

While the classical Collatz conjecture focuses on convergence, this project investigates a 5-adic transformation that generates strictly increasing sequences of odd primes.

By extending the set of constants c to include ±3 and applying a parity-preserving rule based on n mod 5, we significantly increase the survival rate of prime chains.

A continuous search over odd integers below 100,000,000 led to the discovery of two length-7 prime chains.

Discovered Length-7 Chains

The following two chains satisfy
p(i+1) = (6*p(i) + c) / 5,
with c chosen to ensure divisibility and parity preservation:

Chain 1 (n₀ = 19,084,201):

19084201
22901041
27481249
32977499
39572999
47487599
56985119

Chain 2 (n₀ = 76,933,159):

76933159
92319791
110783749
132940499
159528599
191434319
229721183

All values were verified prime using deterministic primality testing.

Mathematical Notes

5-adic branching:

If n ≡ 1 (mod 5):  f(n) = (6n − 1) / 5
If n ≡ 2 (mod 5):  f(n) = (6n + 3) / 5
If n ≡ 3 (mod 5):  f(n) = (6n − 3) / 5
If n ≡ 4 (mod 5):  f(n) = (6n + 1) / 5

This ensures integer outputs and maintains odd parity throughout the chain.

Parity Preservation:

By choosing c ∈ {±1, ±3}, the numerator (6n + c) remains odd for all odd n, preventing the sequence from falling into even-number traps.
